# Jobly 

## Overview
Jobly is a comprehensive job application tracking web app specifically designed for tech students. It provides a seamless experience for students and other job seekers to track their applications information, stay organized, and enhance their job search process. Jobly also comes with unique functionality, such as the ability to automatically track applications via gmail parsing as well as the ability to quickly identify the likely visa sponsorship status of a job of interest. 

## Important Notes
- **Currently in order to use the firebase functionality, you will need access to the firebase API key. Please email nym15@txstate.edu to get access.**
- **Also please note the gmail parsing functionality is currently only supported for linkedin confirmation emails. Additionally, due to Google's OAuth verification requirements, you will need to send the gmail you wish to use for parsing to nym15@txstate.edu to get access. Unfortunately, Google does not allow for external gmails to be used for OAuth verification until our application is verified. As such, for now, if you wish to use the gmail parsing you will need to email us so your gmail can be added to the list of authorized internal users at this time. We are sorry in advance for this inconveinence.**
